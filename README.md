# Linux-Secure-Server

A project to create a local repository with scripts and ideas to secure a linux server or virtual machine. 


## FAQ

#### Is my linux-server safe after the tips? 

To be honest, no. You aren't safe, you are safer! Most of the people don't really care about the security
of their data - "there's nothing which is problematic". But in the actual generation, there is so much risk, 
so much hacks. 

#### Are the scripts and tips up-to-date?

We try our best to update the scripts as much as possible. If we forgot one, or a few points, just create a ticket
and tell us what's wrong or what's better than we did.
